# Install Docker
# TODO(bentheelder): the `sed` is a bit of a hack, look into alternatives.
# Why this exists: `docker service start` on debian runs a `cgroupfs_mount` method,
# We're already inside docker though so we can be sure these are already mounted.
# Trying to remount these makes for a very noisy error block in the beginning of
# the pod logs, so we just comment out the call to it... :shrug:
